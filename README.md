TEIL Biomass Grid Supply Power Project, Chandanpur, Uttar Pradesh

The project TEIL Biomass Grid Supply Power Project, Chandanpur, Uttar Pradesh is located
at Village: Chandanpur, Tehsil: Hasanpur, District: Amroha, State: Uttar Pradesh (UP), Country:
India (Pin: 244241).

The details of the UCR project activity are as follows:

The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass and thereby
reduce GHG emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid based electricity with
biomass based renewable electricity.
The electricity produced by the project is directly contributing to climate change mitigation by
reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere by
displacing an equivalent amount of fossil power at grid.
The project activity has displaced 91363 MWh from the Indian grid system during this
monitoring period, which otherwise would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuelbased grid-connected power plants. The project activity doesnâ€™t involve any GHG emission
sources. The estimated CO2e emission reductions by the project activity for this monitored
period is 68800 tCO2e.

As per the power purchase agreement (PPA) between the state electricity board (UPPCL) and
project proponent, dated 25/06/2012, the project activity generates a total of 10MW of power and
supplies approximately 3 MW of this bagasse based power to the grid. The project activity is the
construction and operation of a power plant/unit that uses renewable energy sources and supplies
electricity to the grid. The implementation of the project does not result in an increase in the
processing capacity of the raw input or any other changes in the sugar manufacturing process.
The power generation is 11 KV, stepped up to 33 KV and synchronization is with the 132 KV
substation of UPPCL (substation at Saidnagli, Ujhari). All the biomass used at the site qualifies
under the definition of biomass residues as outlined in the methodology, i.e. the biomass residue
is a by-product of agricultural activities and no other types of biomass is used. In the case of the
project activity, the biomass residue is bagasse, which is generated from the crushing of sugar
cane. Hence, the project activity is a grid-connected biomass (bagasse based) cogeneration
power plant with a high pressure steam-turbine configuration. The high pressure boilers are fired
by bagasse, a biomass by product from the sugar manufacturing process, to generate steam which
in turn is fed to the steam turbine to generate power. The overall business is integrated with
alcohol distillation and power generation. The power co-generation units generate biomass based
power for captive consumption of the sugar plant and the sale of surplus power to the state grid.
The project plant exports power to the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), in
absence of the project activity, UPPCL would have withdrawn electricity from northern regional
grid.
